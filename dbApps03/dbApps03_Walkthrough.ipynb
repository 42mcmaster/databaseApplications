    "\n",
    "**Data vs. Information:**\n",
    "- **Data** is raw, unprocessed facts (e.g., \"25\", \"female\", \"yes\")\n",
    "- **Information** is processed data with context and meaning (e.g., \"25-year-old female passenger survived\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Database?**\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of related data, structured to allow efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Instead of scattered CSV files, a database provides:\n",
    "- **Structure**: Tables with clearly defined columns and data types\n",
    "- **Relationships**: Links between tables (one table can reference another)\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Fast queries on large datasets\n",
    "- **Integrity**: Rules to ensure data quality and consistency\n",
    "- **Security**: Access control and audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Databases Instead of CSVs?**\n",
    "- CSVs are simple but limited: they're flat files with no structure, no data types, and slow searches on large files\n",
    "- Databases enforce data types, allow complex queries, and scale to millions of rows\n",
    "- In Lesson 02, you filtered a small CSV in memory with pandas. For enterprise data, that approach breaks down — databases are designed for this\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is SQLite?**\n",
    "SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine. It's perfect for learning because:\n",
    "- No separate server to install\n",
    "- Built into Python (and most languages)\n",
    "- Stores data in a single `.db` file\n",
    "- Uses SQL (the universal language for databases)\n",
    "- Fast for small-to-medium datasets"
