    "1. **CREATE TABLE & INSERT**\n",

    "   - Use `conn.commit()` to save changes\n",
    "   - Verify data with `pd.read_sql()`\n",

    "2. **UPDATE & DELETE**\n",
    "   - Always test your WHERE clause with SELECT first\n",
    "   - Use UPDATE to modify existing records\n",
    "   - Use DELETE to remove records\n",
    "   - Never execute UPDATE or DELETE without a WHERE clause\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constraints**\n",
    "   - NOT NULL: Make a column required\n",
    "   - UNIQUE: Ensure no duplicate values\n",
    "   - DEFAULT: Specify a default value\n",
    "   - CHECK: Validate data with conditions\n",
