    "**A - Atomicity:**\n",
    "\"All or nothing\" - A transaction is complete in its entirety or not at all.  \n",
    "*Bank example:* When we transferred $200 from Account 1 to Account 2, BOTH the withdrawal and deposit happened, or NEITHER happened. We could never have a state where Account 1 was debited but Account 2 wasn't credited. If there was an error after the withdrawal, the ROLLBACK would undo it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C - Consistency:**\n",
    "The database moves from one valid state to another valid state.  \n",
    "*Bank example:* The total amount of money in the system must always stay the same (conservation of money). A $200 transfer should never create or destroy money. Before: $50,000 total. After: $50,000 total. The database remains in a consistent, valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I - Isolation:**\n",
    "Transactions are independent and don't interfere with each other.  \n",
    "*Bank example:* If two people are transferring money at the same time, their transactions are isolated. Person A's transfer doesn't interfere with Person B's transfer. Each transaction acts as if it's the only one running.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D - Durability:**\n",
    "Once committed, the changes are permanent and survive system failures.  \n",
    "*Bank example:* Once we COMMIT the $200 transfer, the change is permanently written to disk. If the power goes out immediately after COMMIT, the transfer is still there when the system comes back up. If the power had gone out BEFORE COMMIT, the transaction wouldn't have happened at all."

    "\n",
    "**The Principle:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "- If someone's account is compromised (hacked), the attacker can only do what that user can do\n",
    "- It limits the blast radius of mistakes (accidental data deletion)\n",
    "- It enforces accountability (if data was deleted, we know who had permission to delete it)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Applies to Database Access:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Accounts in the Database**\n",
    "   - Create a separate database user for each application role\n",
    "   - App user account: Can SELECT and INSERT, but NOT DROP or DELETE\n",
    "   - Admin account: Can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER\n",
    "   - Read-only account: Can SELECT only\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table-Level Permissions**\n",
    "   - Payroll staff: Can view the payroll table, but not the audit log\n",
    "   - HR staff: Can view the employees table and edit some fields, but NOT salary data\n",
    "   - Accountants: Can view all financial tables, but NOT employee passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Row-Level Security**\n",
    "   - A teacher can only see grades for their own classes\n",
    "   - A regional manager can only see sales for their region\n",
    "   - A nurse can only see patients they're assigned to, not all hospital patients\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Column-Level Permissions**\n",
    "   - Employees can see colleague names and email, but NOT salary\n",
    "   - Managers can see employee names and performance reviews, but NOT private notes\n",

    "### Question:\n",
    "Why are transactions important for data integrity? Give a real-world scenario where missing a transaction could cause problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Transactions Matter:**\n",
    "Transactions ensure that multiple database operations either all succeed together or all fail together. They prevent partial updates that leave data in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Scenario: The Missing Transaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an online store without transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer buys a laptop for $1,000\n",
    "2. Step 1: Add $1,000 to the seller's account balance\n",
    "3. Step 2: Deduct $1,000 from the customer's account balance\n",
    "4. Step 3: Insert a record in the \"orders\" table\n",
    "\n",
    "If the system crashes after Step 1 but before Step 2 completes:\n",
    "- The seller's account has +$1,000 (seller gets paid)\n",
    "- The customer's account was NOT debited (customer keeps their money)\n",
    "- The order was NOT recorded (store has no record of the sale)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** \n",
    "- Store lost $1,000\n",
    "- Customer got the laptop for free\n",
    "- No one can track what happened\n",
    "- Data integrity is completely broken\n",
    "\n",
    "**With a Transaction:**\n",
    "All three steps are wrapped in a transaction. If any step fails, the entire transaction rolls back. Either:\n",
    "- All three succeed and commit together, OR\n",
    "- All three fail and rollback together\n",
    "- No partial updates. No inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Real-World Scenarios:**\n",
    "- **Booking an airline seat**: Add passenger to flight, deduct seat from inventory, record payment. All or nothing.\n",
    "- **Hospital medication**: Update patient dosage, record in patient chart, update pharmacy inventory. All or nothing.\n",
    "- **Bank transfer**: Debit source account, credit destination account, create audit log. All or nothing.\n",
    "- **Inventory management**: Record purchase order, deduct from warehouse stock, update supplier records. All or nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:**\n",
    "When you have multiple related database changes, ALWAYS wrap them in a transaction. Don't assume the system won't crash. Murphy's Law applies to databases: \"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at the worst possible time.\""
