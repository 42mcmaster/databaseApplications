   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### List 3 Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**\n",
    "   - Separate SQL structure from user input\n",
    "   - Use ? placeholders in SQLite, named parameters in others\n",
    "   - The database driver handles escaping and validation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Never Concatenate or Interpolate User Input**\n",
    "   - Avoid f-strings: `f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {userInput}\"`\n",
    "   - Avoid format(): `\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {}\".format(userInput)`\n",
    "   - Avoid string concatenation: `\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '\" + userInput + \"'\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validate and Sanitize Input**\n",
    "   - Check data types (is it a number when it should be?)\n",
    "   - Check length and format (email, phone, etc.)\n",
    "   - Use whitelist validation (allow only known good values)\n",
    "   - Even with parameterized queries, validation adds a layer of defense\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Practices:\n",
    "- Use stored procedures in enterprise databases (less applicable in SQLite)\n",
    "- Apply principle of least privilege (users have only necessary permissions)\n",
    "- Keep your database framework and libraries updated\n",
    "- Log and monitor SQL queries for suspicious patterns"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Question:\n",
    "Why is string concatenation dangerous **even when YOU control the input**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Future Developers**\n",
    "   - You might leave the company or move to another project\n",
    "   - Another developer might copy this code pattern elsewhere\n",
    "   - They might use it with untrusted user input without realizing the danger\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reuse & Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Code gets refactored, copied, and pasted\n",
    "   - A function that currently takes only hardcoded values might be modified later to accept user input\n",
    "   - If the foundation is unsafe, the change becomes dangerous\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Habit Formation**\n",
    "   - Writing unsafe code creates bad habits\n",
    "   - When you encounter a real user input scenario, you might use the same pattern without thinking\n",
    "   - Muscle memory defaults to the \"easy\" approach, which is the dangerous one\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Copy-Paste to Other Projects**\n",
    "   - You might use this code as a template for another project\n",
    "   - The next time, the input might come from an API, user form, or file\n",
    "   - The vulnerable code pattern is already embedded\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution:\n",
    "**Always code defensively. Use parameterized queries from the start, even for hardcoded values.**\n",
    "- It's not much harder than string concatenation\n",
    "- It protects you against future mistakes\n",
    "- It sets a good example for other developers\n",
